# Overview

This application is a simulation of an inventory management app. The user will be provided with a menu giving them a
choice
to buy or sell items. The user will be able to purchase items and add them to the inventory, while having money deducted
from their inventory. The user will also be able to show their inventory and choose an item to sell.
The menu will provide an option to exit the application and will be thanked for using the app.

This is my first Kotlin application using Intellij IDEA. This was a simple app to give me an introduction into learning
the kotlin language.
